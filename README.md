# Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK) Project in Rust

### Overview

This project implements a simple Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK) system in Rust. It includes a custom circuit implementation with basic arithmetic gates, a Merkle tree structure, and an R1CS-based constraint system.

### Tests
`main.rs` contains test module with integrations tests, including proof of addition test, proof of multiplication test and merkle proof test.
